Creating a Virtual Environment: If you want to ensure that your project uses Python 3.12, create a virtual environment with that version:

# If you have Python 3.12 installed
`python3.12 -m venv myenv` \
`Then activate the environment:`

# On Windows:

`myenv\Scripts\activate`

# On macOS/Linux:

`source myenv/bin/activate`

# After activating the virtual environment, you can install your requirements:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
